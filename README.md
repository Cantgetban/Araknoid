# Araknoid
This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.

# About
I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course i took during my bachelor degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

# The Goal
Remove all blocks in each level by striking them with the ball.

# Instructions
* Use 'Left' and 'Right' arrows in your keyboard in order to move the paddle.
* Press 'p' to pause the game.
* press 'space' to return to the game.
* every block that you remove grant you 5 points, every level that you pass grant you 100 points. try to get the highest score !
